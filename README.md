Hi, I'm Michael Cassidy.

I'm insterested in listening to what the data has to say, and bringing that to the people. 

In the past I have worked on; instructing students in macro and microeconomics, ETL processes and product development for time-series databases, product management and financial analytic development for large data corporations, and co-authoring research at the intersection of NLP and Monetary Policy.

I'm currnetly firming up my understanding of Docker, Graphana, and more advanced SQL queries.

You can reach me at michael.v.cassidy@gmail.com.
