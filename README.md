Hi, I'm Michael Cassidy.

I'm insterested in listening to what the data has to say, and bringing that to the people. 

In the past I have worked on; instructing students in macro and microeconomics, ETL processes and product development for time-series databases, product management and financial analytic development for large data corporations, and co-authoring research at the intersection of NLP and Monetary Policy.

I'm currently learning more about data science methods (NLP, Machine Vision, CV) and tools (Python, R, SQL, Regressions).

I'm looking to collaborate on Kaggle competitions and any other ways to learn new tools and processes.

You can reach me at michael.v.cassidy@gmail.com.
